# fontman (font manager)

The font manager for MacOS

It's like a package manager but for fonts!

### Last Updated April 24, 2024

## Installation and Setup

This is currently not finished; for now, download and unzip the project, install the
dependencies, and make an empty "fonts" folder in the same level as the project.

In the future, I plan for users to be able to run:

```bash
python3 fontman.py init
```

This has not yet been implemented.

## Usage

A list of open source fonts is still to be made. However, I've verified
the full or partial functionality of the following commands:

* install
* remove
* list
* info

To install a font:

```bash
python3 fontman.py install <font-id>
```

To remove a font:

```bash
python3 fontman.py remove <font-id>
```

To get info about a font:

```bash
python3 fontman.py info <font-id>
```

And finally, to list installed fonts:

```bash
python3 fontman.py list
```

## More to Come

More updates are to come to this project, stay tuned!
